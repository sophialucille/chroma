# chroma
Visual audio project using Arduino Unos, Max 8, and WS2812b LED strip
Made in late 2018

The idea of the project was to use an LED Strip to visually represent a piano. Every 3 pixels would designate a note on a piano. Each note would have a specific color where the lower the octave, the darker the color and vice versa. The project was designed to be used with 3 LED Strips, each representing a different instrument (in this case, a piano, bass and synth). The code is rudamentary and only allows one note to be played at a time on each strip.
