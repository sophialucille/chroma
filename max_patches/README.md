The files in this folder are for two different purposes. The "color_mapping_V8(main).maxpat" file is when you are running everything off of one computer. At the time when this project was presented, we did not have long enough cable so we ran the project off of 3 laptops. Each laptop had a different "instrument" or LED strip connected to it. Each computer used the "color_mapping_V8(performance_bass_main).maxpat", "color_mapping_V8(performance_celesta).maxpat", and "color_mapping_V8(performance_piano).maxpat" files respectively. This does present the issue of syncing the audio properly. Since we couldn't have the each computer's Max Patch communicate, it came down to a countdown and hopefully pressing start at the right time :)
